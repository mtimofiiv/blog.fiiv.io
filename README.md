This is the source for my blog. Just go to the main site if you want to see it.

I used to use Medium but it started annoying me, so I threw this together instead.

 * Built in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and the theme is my own.
 * Fonts are [Chunk](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk) and [Sorts Mill Goudy](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy) from the amazing folks at [The League of Movable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/)
 * I use the [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) gem as part of a very minimal CI suite, which essetially just lints HTML.
 * _TODO_ using [mtimofiiv/imagecondom](https://github.com/mtimofiiv/imagecondom) to dynamically serve images instead of cutting them.
