I've always liked writing, and lately, in order to really scratch that itch, I've started this blog. I write irregularly, whenever I really feel like it, and for no one at all but myself.

If you like any of my stuff, great. Constructive criticism is also very welcome, because without it, I would never learn. [Drop me a note](/contact)!

## A note about old browsers

I am a web developer by trade, and I don't care about supporting old browsers. I do way too much legacy stuff for old Internet Explorer versions at work, and I refuse to lift a finger to support those old standards on my own personal blog. There's some pretty new stuff used on this site, such as `flexbox` which is guaranteed to break on old IE.

So if you're having that issue - don't upgrade your browser for me, do it for yourself.
